  <p title="Ben 10" id="para">
    Doraemon (ドラえもん, Doraemon) is the most recent anime TV series based on Fujiko Fujio's manga of the same name. Produced by Shin-Ei Animation and Asatsu-DK, it began airing on TV Asahi on April 15, 2005. It also airs in over 50 countries worldwide.

    This Doraemon anime series is sometimes referred to in Asia as the Mizuta Edition (水田版), after Wasabi Mizuta, the voice actress who voiced Doraemon in this series.[2]
    
    The anime is licensed by Viz Media for broadcast rights only. An edited English dub produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment has been airing on Disney XD in the United States since July 7, 2014 and has been given a TV-Y7 rating.[3][4] A second season of the English dub premiered on Disney XD on June 15, 2015[5] and ended on September 1.
    
    As of 2020, TV Asahi currently holds distribution and licensing rights to Doraemon. However, they mentioned that due to the show's success in India, they would be continuing their contract with Disney Channel India for Doraemon to be aired in India. They also noted the shows success in Spain, Portugal and the rest of Europe. On March 3, 2020, Viz Media uploaded the whole 2 seasons of Doraemon's US dub to its dedicated YouTube channel when their contract was about to end. Their YouTube account, however, was terminated in June 2020 over several TV Asahi copyright claims relating to the use of Doraemon without a valid contract. </p>
